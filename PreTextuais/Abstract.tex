   Matching problems are critical in various industrial applications, such as job assignment, scheduling, and resource allocation. However, existing optimization solutions are often complex, rigid, or inaccessible to practitioners without specialized expertise. This dissertation proposes the design of a flexible framework for defining and solving matching and grouping problems, enabling users to configure relational data and optimization constraints without requiring deep knowledge of optimization techniques.

    Beyond the framework design, this work presents an initial implementation and introduces a novel matching algorithm under quota constraints. This algorithm ensures fairness and feasibility in resource allocation scenarios where quotas play a crucial role. By bridging the gap between theoretical matching models and practical applications, this research provides a structured yet adaptable approach to solving real-world matching problems.
